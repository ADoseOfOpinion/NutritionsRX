        <p class = "quote"><strong>“The doctor of the future will no longer treat the human frame with drugs, but rather will cure and prevent disease with nutrition.”</strong></p>
        <p class = "quote"> - Thomas Edison</p>
        <p>As a nutrition professional, my goal is to provide easy-to-follow nutrition tips to improve the quality of life of others. By following the current, scientifically approved nutrition practices and making little but consistent progress, you can make a huge impact on your overall wellness and create a sense of accomplishment. </p>
        <p>The human body is the most efficient pharmacy for preventing and curing diseases as long as we continuously replenish our body with nutrients. How nourished we are can greatly impact and benefit one’s quality of life and life expectancy. Chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, etc. are the major causes of health complications among our older population today. Being nourished and physically active are key factors in preventing, alleviating, or even curing these chronic diseases.</p>
        <p>Eating plenty of colorful vegetables and fruits can effectively prevent chronic diseases. These foods contain many nutrients including polyphenols or phytochemicals, which are very important antioxidants. These antioxidants have been researched frequently by health professionals and are important scavengers that find and remove free radicals from our body. They also help prevent or repair the damage to body cells.</p>
        <p>MyPlate is a good source of dietary guidelines for Americans. Your meal plan should contain five food groups including grains, vegetables, fruits, protein, and dairy. Eating a nutritious and balanced diet is important in maintaining a strong immune system. Please visit <a target = "_blank" href = "www.choosemyplate.gov ">Choose My Plate</a> for more daily dietary intake suggestions.</p>
        <p>As a nutrition specialist, my responsibility and goal is to help people eat healthy and stay healthy.</p>
